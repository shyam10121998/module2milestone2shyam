        <h1>Top 10 Flowering deciduous trees</h1>
        <P>You know spring is here and can put the winter blues behind, at the sight of a deciduous tree in full bloom. While most deciduous trees flower in spring, there are some very nice summer flowering types. When choosing a tree make sure the mature size and spread will fit in the landscape. Ask if the tree is suitable for our climate, the Comox Valley is considered ZONE 7, there are micro climates that are warmer than the average Temperature and able to grow the more exotic types like the Empress tree. Important are soil conditions, most require well-drained soils in winter and do not tolerate standing water. Try to pick trees that offer more than just blooms, example interesting form or leaves, fall color or unique bark for seasonal interest. Don't over look planting fruit trees they put on a pretty good display, while the blooms may be short lived, you can always look forward to eating the fruit.
