        <h1>Top 10 Dwarf Conifers</h1>
        <P>Dwarf conifers are suitable for any garden, especially were space may be limited. They also make great rockery and container plants, providing year round interest and color to the landscape. The term dwarf can be misleading as conifers never stop growing and are long lived plants. So be careful, choose plants that are either slow growing or prune to maintain size, so they don't outgrow their space in the garden.
            <br><strong>1# Fir 'Dwarf Balsam' Abies Balsamea nana:</strong> Rounded shrub with glossy dark bluish-green foliage, bright green new growth in spring. A nice shrub for shade gardens.

            <br><strong>2# Cedrus 'Feeling Blue' Cedrus deodara:</strong>  Low spreading shrub with blue-grey foliage. Suitable for any garden or trailing over rocks & walls. Prune to maintain spread.
            
            <br><strong>3# Crytomeria 'Tenzan' Cryptomeria japonica:</strong>Ball form with deep green foliage turning deep purple in winter. Small specimen shrub with winter interest.
