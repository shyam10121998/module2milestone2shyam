            <p>Dwarf conifers are suitable for any garden, especially were space may be limited. They also make great rockery and container plants, providing year round interest and color to the landscape. The term dwarf can be misleading as conifers never stop growing and are long lived plants. So be careful, choose plants that are either slow growing or prune to maintain size, so they don't outgrow their space in the garden...</p>

            <p>Ornamental grasses can add interest, form and texture to the landscape. Most grasses are easy to grow, simply water during the hot summer months and fertilize in spring.

            <p>While most people are attracted to the bright colored foliage of purple and yellow leaved maples, it's the green types that usually produce the best fall colors. Most are easy to grow and are suitable for full sun or partial shade, although too much afternoon shade...</p>
