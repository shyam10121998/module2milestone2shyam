        <h1>Top 10 Weeping Japanese Maples</h1>
        <P>There are so many available on the market today it's a little overwhelming. They come in large variety of shapes and colors. The weeping or cascading forms are usually low growing with a mushroom-shaped form. Most but not all have delicate laceleaf foliage and are suitable for mixed borders, containers, rockeries or cascading over a water feature. Easy to care for, all they need is well-drained soil (never water-logged conditions) and sun exposure depends on the cultivar. Young plants may scorch in hot afternoon sun, especially on a deck or concrete patio. Resembling drought, the fine leaves curl and turn brown at the tips, if severe enough the whole leave is affected. Don't panic and over water, they will become resistant to this as they get older. Give them room to mature, while considered a small maple they can develop a large spread with age, or simply prune and shape to maintain a smaller size.
            <br><strong>1#</strong> 'Crimson Queen' Acer palmatun dissectum: Laceleaf cascading type with dense wine-red foliage turning brilliant red in fall. Very popular selection and easy to grow.

            <br><strong>2#</strong>  'Green Cascade' Acer japonicum: A unique weeping maple with broad dissected leaves. The green foliage turns bright yellow, orange and red in fall.

            <br><strong>4#</strong> 'Lionheart' Acer palmatum dissectum: An unusual selection of laceleaf maple with reddish-purple foliage and red fall color. The weeping branches are similar to other dissectums, what makes it different is the height, growing taller with a layered look.
            
            <br><strong>5#</strong> 'Orangelo' Acer palmatum dissectum: The chameleon of the maple world this cascade maple changes color all season.
