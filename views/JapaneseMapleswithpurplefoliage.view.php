        <h1>Top 10 Japanese Maples with purple foliage</h1>
        <P>The ten listed below are all upright types, but very different from each other in form, leave type or height. Like the green leaved maples there are so many out there. Choosing the right one will depend on personal taste and the space available. While any Japanese maple can be pruned to restrict height, some can grow large, making them unsuitable for small gardens or containers. With the selection available, it's better to find a cultivar that fits rather than trying to contain the growth with annual pruning. Most purple leaved maples need afternoon sun to achieve the best color and turn greenish in too much shade. There are exception like Red Dragon and Fireglow, which can handle afternoon shade without losing their color. I can't stress the importance of well-drained soil especially in winter for the heath of your Japanese maple. This also goes for container grown maples, never use garden soil or a heavy peat based potting mix, which retains to much moisture in winter. What works the best for us is straight bark mulch when potting up. We use a medium grade of Douglas fir and Hemlock bark with some larger pieces mixed in and a slow release fertilizer in spring. This mix allows for excellent drainage and air flow to the root system without becoming compacted or water-logged. 
            <br><strong>1# 'Beni otaki' Acer palmatum:  </strong>This graceful maple has a bamboo-like appearance with deeply dived long narrow leaves. The spring color is bright red, summer foliage reddish-purple then turning crimson in fall. While this beautiful maple can reach a good size with time, it's fairly slow growing and can be maintained with pruning. Makes a nice maple for large containers or as specimen tree. Best color in full or afternoon sun.

            <br><strong>2# Empereor one: Acer palmatum:</strong>A large growing Japanese maple similar to Bloodgood in appearance but much bigger. Fairly fast growing with a wide canopy and beautiful deep reddish-purple foliage in summer. A attractive addition to the landscape but not suitable for very small gardens. Plant in full sun or partial shade.
            
            <br><strong>3# Fireglow: Acer palmatum: </strong>Shrub-like tree with dense branching. Slow growing it reaches a height of about 16'-21' at maturity or sometimes higher. Bright red spring color, turning a wine-red in summer. It's the fall color that gives this maple its name a fiery glowing red. Well it retains the summer color well in afternoon shade it will affect the fall color. 


            
            <br><strong>4# Oshio beni: Acer palmatum:</strong> Different describes this outstanding colored maple. Shrub-like, it's slow growing and reaches a height of 16'-20' tall at maturity. The broad leaves are bright red in spring and turns a unique reddish-orange in summer, the fall color is a outstanding glowing red. This maple needs afternoon sun to show off its unique color. The slow growth makes it suitable for small gardens or large containers.
            
            <br><strong>5# Pixie: Acer palmatum:  </strong> Pixie is another new cultivar available on the market today, thought to be a sport from  Bloodgood. This densely branched dwarf matures to a height of about 6.5' tall and wide. The bright pink-reddish spring leaves are deeply dived and turn a deep red in summer. Fall color is a bright crimson, this small maple is suitable for any small garden, large rockery or containers.  
            
            <br><strong>6# Purple ghost: Acer palmatum:</strong> Still fairly rare and hard to find, this outstanding maple has very unusual color, growing to about 10'-12' tall with a rounded form. The glowing red with darker veins is stunning in the spring, turning a darker color in summer and finishing in fall a fiery orange and scarlet. This is a must have for the Japanese maple collector and suitable for small gardens or large containers.
            
            <br><strong>7# Red pygmy: Acer palmatum: </strong>Dwarf vase-shaped form becoming rounded when older, reaching 8' tall x 5'-6' wide at maturity. The strap-like leaves are very long and narrow and divided to the base. Color in the spring and fall is reddish-orange, turning dark green and then deep purple for the summer. A very hardy dwarf maple suitable for small gardens or containers. This little maple is quite happy in both sun or partial shade.
            
            <br><strong>8# Sherwood flame: Acer palmatum:  </strong>Has a rounded form, reaching 13'-16' tall x 13' wide and densely branched. The deeply dived leaves are an unusual shade of reddish-purple, almost burgundy. This graceful small tree makes a nice addition to any garden or in large containers. Best color in full or afternoon sun. 
            
            <br><strong>9# Trompenburg: Acer palmatum:</strong> Unique is the word for this tree, reaching 20'-26' tall x 13'-16' wide. The deeply dived seven to nine lobed leaves are a glossy dark purple in summer and very distinctive because the edges are curled inward. Add bright crimson fall color and you have a very attractive large Japanese maple. Fairly rapid growing I don't recommend it for containers or small gardens. Best color in full or afternoon sun.
            
            <br><strong>10# Yubea: Acer palmatum:</strong>Densely branched, shrub-like tree reaching 16'-20' tall at maturity, definitely a slow grower so that will take some time. The attractive smaller leaves are very dark red to maroon color. Grow in full or afternoon sun for best color. While the fall color is not as notable as some of the other purple varieties, the very dark summer foliage sets this maple apart from the rest.    </p>
